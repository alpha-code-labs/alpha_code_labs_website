      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy outlines the data practices of mobile games developed and published by <strong>Alpha Code Labs</strong> (hereafter referred to as "we", "our", or "Service Provider"). All our games are provided as free-to-play experiences and are intended for use "AS IS."
      </p>

      <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        Our games do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information. Users are not required to create accounts, submit names, emails, or phone numbers, or grant access to device features beyond those needed for standard gameplay functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>2. No Advertisements</h2>
      <p>
        We do not include third-party advertisements or marketing SDKs in our games. Your experience will not be interrupted or influenced by external ads or in-app promotions.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Tools</h2>
      <p>
        Our games may be developed using tools such as the Unity game engine. These platforms may automatically collect non-personal technical information such as device type, operating system, and crash data to help improve app performance. This data, if collected, is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party services (e.g., Unity Technologies).
      </p>

      <h2>4. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our games are designed to be family-friendly and do not knowingly collect any data from children under the age of 13 (or the age of majority in your region). As no personal data is gathered, no special parental consent is required.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        While no personal information is collected, we follow industry best practices to ensure our games remain safe and secure. Users are encouraged to keep their devices updated and protected.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Updates to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be posted on this page. Continued use of our games after updates indicates acceptance of the revised terms.
      </p>
