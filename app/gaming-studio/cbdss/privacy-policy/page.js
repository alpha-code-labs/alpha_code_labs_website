        <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          Cricket Stack Smash does not collect, store, or share any personal data from its users. The game does not require users to create accounts, provide personal information (such as name, email address, or phone number), or grant access to device features beyond what is required for normal gameplay.

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          Cricket Stack Smash is built using the Unity game engine. While the game itself does not collect any data, please be aware that Unity may collect certain technical data (e.g., device model, operating system, unique device identifiers) solely for performance analytics or crash reporting. This data collection, if any, is governed by Unity’s own privacy policy. We recommend reviewing Unity’s Privacy Policy to understand their data-handling practices.

        <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>

          Cricket Stack Smash does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of majority in your jurisdiction). Since no personal data is requested or stored, no special parental consent is required. If you believe your child has provided any personal information without your consent, please contact us, and we will take steps to remove such information.
        </p>
  
        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
          Although Cricket Stack Smash does not collect personal information, we are committed to ensuring that our game and any minimal technical data collected through Unity adhere to industry-standard security measures. Users are advised to keep their mobile devices updated and secure against unauthorized access.
